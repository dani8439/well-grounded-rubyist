## *Array conversion with to_a and the * operator* ##
The `to_a` (to array) method, if defined, provides an array-like representation of objects. One of `to_a`'s most striking 
features is that it automatically ties in with the * operator. The * operator (pronounced "star," "unarray," or, among the whimsically 
inclined, "splat") does a kind of unwrapping of its operand into its components, those components being the elements of its array 
representation.
