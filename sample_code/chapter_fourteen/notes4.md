## *Issuing commands from inside Ruby programs* ## 
You can issue system commands in several ways in Ruby. We'll look primarily at two of them; the `system` method and the `(backticks)` technique. The other ways to communicate with system programs involve somewhat lower-level programming and are more system-dependent and therefore somewhat outside the scope of this book. We'll take a brief look at them nonetheless, and if they seem to be something you need, you can explore them further.

### *The system method and backticks* ### 
The `system` method calls a system program. Backticks (`''` --> not actual backticks, can't write them without throwing MD doc out of whack) call a system program and return its output. The choice depends on what you want to do.

#### EXECUTING SYSTEM PROGRAMS WITH THE SYSTEM METHOD #### 
To use `system`, send it the name of the program you want to run, with any arguments. The program uses the current `STDIN`, `STDOUT`, and `STDERR`. Here are three simle examples, `cat` and `grep` require pressing Ctrl-d (or whatever the "end-of-file" key is on your system) to terminate them and return control to irb. For clarity, Ruby's output is in bold and user input is in regular font:

```irb
>> system("date")
Fri Jul 13 19:53:35 UTC 2018
=> true
>> system("cat")
I'm typing on the screen for the cat command.
I'm typing on the screen for the cat command.
>> system('grep "D"')

When you use `system`, the global variable `$?` is set to a `Process::Status` object that contains information abou tthe call: specifically, the process ID of the process you just ran and its exit status. Here's a call to `date` and one to `cat`, the latter terminated with Ctrl-c. Each is followed by examination of `$?`:

```irb 
>> system("date")
Fri Jul 13 19:58:18 UTC 2018
=> true
>> $?
=> #<Process::Status: pid 418 exit 0>
>> system("cat")
^C=> false
>> $?
=> #<Process::Status: pid 28026 SIGINT (signal 2)>
```
And here's a call to a nonexistent program:

```irb
>> system("dates")
=> nil
>> $?
=> #<Process::Status: pid 420 exit 127>
```
The `$?` variable is thread-local: if you call a program in one thread, its return value affects only the `$?` in that thread:

```irb 
```
