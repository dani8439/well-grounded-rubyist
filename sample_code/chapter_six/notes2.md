## Repeating Action with Loops ##
Ruby's facilities for looping repeatedly through code also allow you to incorporate conditional logic: you can loop *while* a 
given condition is true (such as a variable being equal to a given value), and you can loop *until* a given condition is true. 
You can also break out of a loop *unconditionally*, terminating the loop at a certain point, and resume execution of the program 
after the loop.

We'll look at several ways to loop-starting, appropriately with a method called `loop`.
