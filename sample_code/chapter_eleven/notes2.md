## *Fine-tuning regular expressions with quantifiers, anchors, and modifiers* ## 
*Quantifiers* let you specify how many times in a row you want something to match. *Anchors* let you stipulate that the match occur at a certain structural point in a string (beginning of string, end of line, at a word boundary, and so on). *Modifiers* are like switches you can flip to change the behavior of the regexp engine; for example, by making it case-sensitive or altering how it handles whitespace.

We'll look at quantifiers, anchors, and modifiers here, in that order.
