## Well-Grounded-Rubyist ##
 This is a repository of information culled from David A. Black's "The Well-grounded Rubyist".
 It includes both notes, and practical examples used in the text.
 
 • There are not notes on everything, but overall more than 85% of material covered in book has been represented here as a way of acquainting myself with MD style. 
 
 • Examples - code blocks used in text to explain concepts. Sometimes these examples include further notes from text. All examples should work in your local environment.

 I am using the Well-Grounded Rubyist as supplementary learning to the Flatiron Web Development Program. As a coding newbie, this is all very daunting. My goal is to learn something new each day, that I didn't know yesterday, in order to better have my bearings before returning to the flatiron curriculum. It's meant for nothing more than personal reference.
